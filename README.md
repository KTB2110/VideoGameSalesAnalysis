# Video Game Sales Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing video game sales data from around the world to find deeper insights. The code is written in Python and uses Pandas to show the output of the SQLite commands I used to conduct the analysis.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in an SQLite database file called "video_games.db". It includes information about video games, their publishers, platforms, genres, release years, and sales numbers across different regions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use SQL and Pandas to analyze video game sales data and extract meaningful insights. The four queries provided in the code can serve as a starting point for further exploration of the data and can be modified or expanded to answer other questions.
